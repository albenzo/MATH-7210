\begin{problem}[1.6.2]
  
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\varphi:G\rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism and let $x\in G$ where $|x|=n$. Since
  $\varphi(x^n)=\varphi(x)^n$ it follows that $|x|\geq|\varphi(x)|$. However
  $\varphi$ is an isomorphism which implies that $\varphi^{-1}$ is also an
  isomorphism. Via the same reasoning this implies that
  $|\varphi(x)|\geq|\varphi^{-1}\circ\varphi(x)=x|$. Therefore $|x|=|\varphi(x)|$.

  If $\varphi$ is an isomorphism and $G_n$ is the set of elements of
  order $n$ in $G$ then $\varphi|_{G_n}$ is a bijection and since
  $\varphi$ preserves orders it follows that we have the same
  number of elements of order $n$ in $G$ and $H$ for any $n$.
\end{proof}

It does not hold if $\varphi$ is not an isomorphism. Consider
$\varphi:\bb{Z}/6\bb{Z}\rightarrow\{e\}$. Then the order of for any $\varphi(x)$ is
$1$.

\begin{problem}[1.6.3]
  
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\varphi:G\rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism and suppose that $H$ is Abelian.
  Then for $x,y\in G$ we have
  \[ xy = \varphi^{-1}\circ\varphi(xy)=\varphi^{-1}(\varphi(x)\varphi(y))=\varphi^{-1}(\varphi(y)\varphi(x))=yx \]
  which implies that $G$ is Abelian. If $G$ is Abelian
  swap $\varphi$ for $\varphi^{-1}$ and the reasoning will be identical to above.

  Therefore if $\varphi:G\rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism then $G$ is Abelian if and
  only if $H$ is Abelian.
\end{proof}

If $\varphi:G\rightarrow H$ is a homomorphism and $H$ is Abelian then we can show that
$G$ is Abelian if $\varphi$ is injective via the proof above as there will be
a well defined inverse on $\varphi(G)$.

Otherwise if $G$ is Abelian we can show that $H$ is Abelian if
$\varphi$ is surjective.

\begin{proof}
  Let $x,y\in H$. Since $\varphi$ is surjective there exist $a,b\in G$ such that
  $\varphi(a)=x$ and $\varphi(b)=y$. Then
  \[ xy = \varphi(a)\varphi(b)=\varphi(ab)=\varphi(ba)=\varphi(b)\varphi(a)=yx \]
  which implies that $H$ is Abelian.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[1.6.4]
  
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $\varphi:\bb{C}^*\rightarrow\bb{R}^*$. Then $\phi(z)=-1$ for some
  $z\in\bb{C}$. However there is a $w\in \bb{C}$ such that $w^2=z$
  which implies that there exists a $y\in\bb{R}^*$ such that
  $\varphi(w)=x$ and that $x^2=-1$ which is impossible.

  Therefore $\bb{C}^*$ and $\bb{R}^*$ are not isomorphic.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}[1.6.7]
  
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  In $\mathcal{Q}_8$ the identity has order $1$, $|-1|=2$, and
  $|i|=|j|=|k|=|-i|=|-j|=|-k|=4$. However in $D_8$ the elements
  $r$ and $\rho^2$ are both of order two. Since $D_8$ has more
  elements of order two than $\mathcal{Q}_8$ they cannot be
  isomorphic.

\begin{problem}[1.6.17]
  
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $G$ be Abelian. Consider the inverse map $\varphi(g)=g^{-1}$.
  Then
  \[ \varphi(g)\varphi(h)=g^{-1}h^{-1}=h^{-1}g^{-1}=\varphi(gh)\]
  and since $e=e^{-1}$ it follows that $\varphi$ is a homomorphism.

  Otherwise suppose that $G$ is not Abelian. This implies that
  exist $g,h\in G$ such that $gh\neq hg$. Then
  \[ \varphi(g^{-1})\varphi(h^{-1})=gh\neq hg = \varphi(g^{-1}h^{-1})\]
  which implies that $\varphi$ cannot be a homomorphism.

\begin{problem}[1.6.25]
  
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[a)] Let $\vc{x}{y}$ be a point in $\bb{R}^2$. Then rewrite $\vc{x}{y}$ in
    polar coordinates as $\vc{r\cos\phi}{r\sin\phi}$. Then if we multiply by the
    rotation matrix we get
    \[
      \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        \cos\theta&-\sin\theta\\
        \sin\theta&\cos\theta
      \end{array}\right)
      \vc{r\cos\phi}{r\sin\phi}
      = \vc{r\cos\theta\cos\phi-r\sin\theta\sin\phi}{r\sin\theta\cos\phi+r\sin\phi\cos\theta}
      = \vc{r\cos(\theta+\phi)}{r\sin(\theta+\phi)}
    \]
    which corresponds to a rotation of $\vc{x}{y}$ counter-clockwise by $\theta$
    as the new angle is $\theta+\phi$.
  \item[b)] Let $\rho\in D_{2n}$. Then we can write $\rho$ in the form $s^ir^m$ where
    $0\leq i<2$ and $0\leq m < n$. This corresponds to rotating by $\frac{2m\pi}{n}$ and
    reflecting $i$ times. 
  \item[c)]
    Suppose that we have two $a,b\in D_{2n}$ such that $\varphi(a)=\varphi(b)$. Since any element
    of $D_{2n}$ can be written in the form $s^ir^m$ it follows that
    \[ \varphi(a)=\varphi(b)= \left(
        \begin{array}{cc}
          0&1\\
          1&0
        \end{array}
      \right)^i\left(
        \begin{array}{rr}
          \cos\frac{2m\pi}{n}&-\sin\frac{2m\pi}{n}\\
          \sin\frac{2m\pi}{n}&\cos\frac{2m\pi}{n}
        \end{array}
      \right)\]
    where $i<2$ and $m<n$ since a homomorphism cannot increase the order of elements.
    However this implies that $$

\begin{proof}
  Since $\mathcal{Q}_8$ is finite we can show that $\varphi:\mathcal{Q}_8\rightarrow \text{GL}_2(\bb{C})$
  by calculating the value of $\varphi$ for each $q\in\mathcal{Q}_8$.

  Since each element of $\mathcal{Q}_8$ maps to a distinct element of
  $\text{GL}_2(\bb{C})$ the homomorphism $\varphi$ is injective.

\begin{proof}
  Let $H,K\leq G$. Then we will show that $H\cap K\leq G$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Since $H,K\leq G$ it follows that $e\in H$ and $e\in K$ which
    implies that $e\in H\cap K$
  \item Let $g\in H\cap K$. Then $g\in H$ and $g\in K$ which implies that
    $g^{-1}\in H$ and $g^{-1}\in K$. It then follows that $g^{-1}\in H\cap K$.
  \item Now let $g,h\in H\cap K$. Then $g,h\in H$ and $g,h\in K$ which implies
    that $gh\in H$ and $gh\in K$. It then follows that $gh\in H\cap K$.

\begin{problem}[2.3.12(a)]
  
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element.
  There are a total of four elements in $Z_2\times Z_2$. These are
  $(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),$ and $(1,1)$. The order of $(0,0)$ is 1,
  and the order of the rest of the elements is $2$. However since
  the size of the group is $4$ it follows that none of the elements
  could generate the group as the size of the group generated is at
  most two.

  Therefore the group $Z_2\times Z_2$ is not cyclic.
