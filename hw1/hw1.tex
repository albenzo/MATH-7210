\begin{problem}
  Let $f:A\ra B$. Then:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[a)] $f$ is injective if and only if it has a left inverse.
  \item[b)] $f$ is surjective if and only if it has a right inverse.
  \item[c)] $f$ is bijective if and only if it has a left and right inverse.
  \item[d)] If $|A|=|B|=n\in \bb{Z}_{\geq0}$ then $f$ is injective if and only if f is
    surjective if and only if $f$ is bijective.
  \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}\ \\
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[a)] Suppose that $f$ is injective. This implies that $f^{-1}(f(a))=\{a\}$ for all
    $a\in A$. Define $g:B\ra A$ as $g(b)=f^{-1}(a)$ where $b\in f(A)$. If $b\notin f(A)$
    then send it to any arbitrary $a\in A$. Then $g\circ f(a)=f^{-1}(f(a))=a$ which implies
    that $g\circ f=id_A$ and that $g$ is a left inverse of $f$.

    Now suppose that there exists a function $g:B\ra A$ such that $g\circ f = id_A$.
    Let $a_0,a_1\in A$ such that $f(a_0)=f(a_1)$. Then
    $g\circ f(a_0)=a_0=a_1=g\circ f(a_1)$ which is the definition of injectivity.

    Therefore $f$ is injective if and only if it has a left inverse.
  \item[b)] Suppose that $f$ is surjective. Then given $b\in B$ there exists an $a\in A$
    such that $f(a)=b$. Define a function $g:B\ra A$ via $g(b)=a$ where $a$ fulfills
    $f(a)=b$. Then $f\circ g(b)=b$ by definition which implies that $g$ is a right
    inverse of $f$.

    Now suppose that there exists a function $g:B\ra A$ such that $f\circ g= id_B$. Then
    given $b\in B$ let $a=g(b)$. Then $f(a)=f\circ g(b)=b$. Since this holds for all
    elements of $b$ $f$ is surjective.

    Therefore $f$ is surjective if and only if it has a right inverse.
  \item[c)] Suppose that $f$ is a bijection. Then it is both injective and surjective
    which by the previous statements in the proposition implies that $f$ has both
    a left and right inverse.

    Otherwise suppose that $f$ has a left and right inverse. Then via the previous
    statements in the proposition we know that $f$ is both injective and surjective and
    thus a bijection.

    To show that the left and right inverse are unique let $g,h$ be a left and right
    inverse for $f$ respectively. Then
    \[g=g\circ id_B=g\circ(f\circ h)=(g\circ f)\circ h=id_A\circ h=h\]

    Therefore $f$ is a bijection if and only if it has a left and right inverse.
    Moreover these inverses are equal.
  \item[d)] Suppose that $|A|=|B|=1$. Then there is only one function $f:A\ra B$
    defined as $f(a_0)=b_0$. As such the function $f$ is injective, surjective and
    bijective.

    Next assume for sets of size $n$ that a function is injective if and only if it
    is surjective if and only if it is bijective. Let $|A|=|B|=n+1$, and 
    without loss of generality let $f$ be injective. Select $a_n$ and $b_n=f(a_n)$
    and look at $f|_{A\setminus \{a_n\}}$. This will preserve injectivity since we removed
    paired items. This implies that $f|_{A\setminus\{a_n\}}$ is injective, surjective, and
    bijective via our inductive hypothesis. Reintroduce the pair $(a_n,b_n)$ to the
    function $f|_{A\setminus \{a_n\}}$. This will preserve injectivity as only $a_n$ maps
    to $b_n$, surjectivity because $b_n$ is mapped to by $a_n$, and as such $f$ is
    bijective.

    Therefore via induction, if $|A|=|B|=n\in \bb{Z}_{>0}$ then a function $f:A\ra B$ is
    injective if and only if it is surjective if and only if it is bijective.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{problem}
  Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation of the set A. For any $a,b\in A$,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[a)] $a\sim b$ if and only if $\bar{a}=\bar{b}$.
  \item[b)] if $\bar{a}\neq \bar{b}$, then $\bar{a}\cap\bar{b}=\phi$
  \end{itemize}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}\ \\
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[a)] Suppose that $a\sim b$. Without loss of generality let $c\in\bar{a}$. Then
    $c\sim a$ which implies that $c\sim b$ by transitivity and as such $c\in\bar{b}$
    Therefore if $a\sim b$ then $\bar{a}=\bar{b}$.

    Now suppose that $\bar{a}=\bar{b}$. Since $a\in\bar{a}$ and $b\in\bar{b}$ by
    reflexivity we know that $a,b\in\bar{b}$ and as such $a\sim b$.

    Therefore $a\sim b$ if and only if $\bar{a}=\bar{b}$.
  \item[b)] Suppose that $\bar{a}\neq\bar{b}$ and that there existed a
    $c\in \bar{a}\cap\bar{b}$. Then $a\sim c$ and $c\sim b$ which would imply that
    $a\sim b$ by transitivity and that $\bar{a}=\bar{b}$ by the previous part of the
    proposition which is a contradiction.

    Therefore if $\bar{a}\neq\bar{b}$ then $\bar{a}\cap\bar{b}=\phi$
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}
  Let $n$ be a fixed positive integer. Then
  \[ (\bb{Z}/n\bb{Z})^\times = \{ \bar{a}\in \bb{Z}/n\bb{Z}|1\leq a\leq n\ \text{and}\ a,n\ \text{are relatively prime}\}\]
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\bar{a}\in(\bb{Z}/n\bb{Z})^\times$. Then $\bar{a}$ has a multiplicative inverse
  $\bar{c}$ such that $\bar{a}\bar{c}=\bar{1}$.

  Otherwise suppose that $a,n$ are relatively prime.
\end{proof}
